# aiogram-bot-BTC
telegram bot which can see the current price of BTC

my first project ever made on aiogram, it's simple but usable

bot won't work without next steps:
1) you should create config.py file in the same place where is the main.py file placed
2) config.py file contain only one line of code: tok='here you paste your bot token'
3) compile main.py file

congrats!!
